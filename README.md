# Curious Katie
This is an algorithm that matches people with different interests so that they can learn from each other.

## Here is how it works
The participants introduce themselves and share their interests. 
After that, Katie partners up participants for a further conversation.

## Here is how to use it
1. Open the Xcode workspace (CuriousKatie.xcworkspace) instead of the project file.
2. Run the project.
3. Observe the result in the Console.
